Grandma William 7
William:Tonight you showed a side of yourself I never dreamed existed.
Red:    [sarcastic/sassy tone]           I am glad I brought honor to my dear grandmother.Â 
William:William said that you seemed to enjoy your punishment?
Red:It was not too terrible. Kind of fun actually!
Red:I do not know if I would even call it punishment.
William:You think that hurts my feelings?
William:It does not. I am beginning to suspect you truly are my granddaughter after all.
