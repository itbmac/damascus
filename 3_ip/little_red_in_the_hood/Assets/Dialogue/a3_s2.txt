Red:I am so very, very glad I brought honor to my dear grandmother.:confident
Grandma:William had mentioned that you seemed to enjoy the outing.:happy
Red:It... wasn't too bad.
Red:Kind of fun.
Red:I don't know if I would even call it punishment.:confident
Grandma:My dear granddaughter, you think that hurts my feelings?
Grandma:It does not.
