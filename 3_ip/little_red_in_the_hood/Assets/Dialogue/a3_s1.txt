Grandma:Well then, how did my misbehaved Little Red enjoy her punishment?
William:The little miss actually did real well, Madam.
William:I was kinda impressed.:happy
Grandma:My, my.:happy
Grandma:Has she shown any hint of apologizing?
William:No. Just her usual bitter pretentious attitude, Madam.
Grandma:Hm, then perhaps a larger punishment is in order.â€‹
Grandma:Have her run the Chinatown route tonight. That will put her in her place.:happy
