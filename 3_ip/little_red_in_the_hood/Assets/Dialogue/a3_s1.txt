Grandma William 6
Grandma:Well then, how did my misbehaved Little Red enjoy her punishment?
William:She actually did really well Ma'am! I was rather impressed!
Grandma:My. My. Did she at least seem sorry?
William:No. Just her usual bitter pretentious attitude.
Grandma:Perhaps a largerÂ punishment is in order.
Grandma:Have her run the Chinatown route tonight. That will put her in her place.
