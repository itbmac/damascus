Grandma William 6
Red:Well then, how did my misbehaved Little Red enjoy her punishment?
William:She actually did really well Ma'am! I was rather impressed!
Red:My. My. Did she at least seem sorry?
William:No. Just her usual bitter pretentious attitude.
Red:Perhaps a largerÂ punishment is in order.
Red:Have her run the Chinatown route tonight. That will put her in her place.
